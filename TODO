= Development TODO list for Gmatchbox =

== Configuration and Installation ==

* Need to abstract DB connection for Model::DBIC
** support sqllite for gmatchbox schema
** postgres does not use longblob - uses bytea; need to SQL::Translator for various RDB flavors at compile/configure time
* Support for external feature DB (prereq; DBIC system for it)
** Adaptor
*** Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
*** Chado (BCS)

== Object adaptors ==

* Need to create object adaptors to convert DBIx::Class HashRefs to consumable JSON objects
* Perhaps drop HashRefInflator and add methods to Result Source classes that return hashes for View::JSON

== Refactor ==

* Controllers need to be refactored into a base class, check doc/dispatch_table.xls
